"""Sample TODOs Dictionary

This module defines a sample dictionary named TODOS, representing a collection
of tasks identified by unique keys. Each task is associated with a description.

Usage:
    - Access tasks using their keys, e.g., TODOS['todo1'] 
    to get details of the first task.
    - Modify or extend the dictionary to track additional tasks as needed.

Example:
    TODOS = {
        "todo1": {"task": "build an API"},
        "todo2": {"task": "?????"},
        "todo3": {"task": "profit!"},
    }

Note: This is a placeholder and can be customized based on the actual content and usage
of your TODOs dictionary. Update the dictionary with real tasks and descriptions.
